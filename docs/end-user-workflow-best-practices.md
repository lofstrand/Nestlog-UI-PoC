# Nestlog – End-User Workflow Best Practices

This guide describes recommended **best practices for end-users** when working in Nestlog.
The goal is to help users work **faster, safer, and with less cognitive load**, regardless of whether they prefer mouse-driven or keyboard-driven interaction.

These practices are aligned with Nestlog’s power-user features and workflow design.

---

## 1. General Workflow Principles

### 1.1 Work in Small, Complete Steps

- Complete one logical task at a time (e.g. create a room → then add assets)
- Avoid jumping between unfinished forms

**Why**

- Reduces mistakes
- Makes auto-save and undo more effective

---

### 1.2 Trust the System State

- Look for visual indicators such as:
  - “Saved”
  - “Draft restored”
  - Validation messages
- Avoid re-submitting actions unless feedback is missing

**Why**

- Prevents duplicate entries
- Keeps data consistent

---

## 2. Creating & Editing Data

### 2.1 Use Explicit Submission

- Use **`Ctrl / Cmd + Enter`** to submit forms
- Use **`Enter`** only for single-line inputs

**Why**

- Prevents accidental submissions
- Works consistently across all forms

---

### 2.2 Use Drafts for Longer Inputs

- When writing descriptions, notes, or comments:
  - Let drafts auto-save
  - Don’t rush submission

**Why**

- Protects against data loss
- Allows you to pause and resume work safely

---

### 2.3 Choose the Right Create Mode

- Enable **“Keep form open after create”** for bulk entry
- Enable **“Close form after create”** for one-off actions

**Why**

- Optimizes repetitive work
- Reduces unnecessary navigation

---

## 3. Navigation & Focus

### 3.1 Rely on Focus, Not the Mouse

- Let forms auto-focus the first input
- Use `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` to move between fields

**Why**

- Faster than mouse interaction
- Reduces hand movement and fatigue

---

### 3.2 Use Search as Your Primary Navigation

- Use global search or list filters instead of browsing manually
- Prefer searching by name, room, or asset type

**Why**

- Scales better as your data grows
- Faster than navigating nested structures

---

## 4. Validation & Error Handling

### 4.1 Fix Errors When They Appear

- Address validation feedback as soon as it is shown
- Don’t ignore warnings before submitting

**Why**

- Prevents repeated submission attempts
- Keeps forms predictable

---

### 4.2 Use “Validate on Submit” for Large Forms

- For long or complex forms, delay validation until submission
- Focus on content first, correctness second

**Why**

- Reduces visual noise
- Improves concentration

---

## 5. Safety & Recovery

### 5.1 Use Undo Instead of Fear

- If you make a mistake:
  - Use the undo window
  - Or cancel and revert changes

**Why**

- Encourages confident usage
- Reduces hesitation and over-checking

---

### 5.2 Be Intentional With Destructive Actions

- Double-check before deleting
- Use confirmation dialogs as a safeguard, not an annoyance

**Why**

- Prevents irreversible data loss
- Maintains trust in the system

---

## 6. Efficiency Tips (Power Users)

### 6.1 Learn a Few Key Shortcuts

Recommended minimum:

- `Ctrl / Cmd + Enter` → Submit
- `Ctrl / Cmd + S` → Save
- `Esc` → Cancel / Close
- `/` → Focus search

**Why**

- Even 3–4 shortcuts significantly improve speed

---

### 6.2 Adjust the UI to Your Style

- Enable **Compact Mode** if you prefer information density
- Reduce animations if you value speed over motion

**Why**

- Personalization improves long-term comfort

---

## 7. Mental Model to Keep

> **Nestlog is optimized for deliberate actions, not rushed clicks.**

- Explicit submits
- Visible feedback
- Safe undo
- Predictable navigation

Working _with_ these principles leads to fewer errors and faster completion over time.

---

## 8. Summary

Following these best practices helps you:

- Work faster with fewer mistakes
- Recover safely from errors
- Scale your usage as your data grows

Nestlog is designed to support both casual and power users — the more intentional your workflow, the more value you get from the system.
